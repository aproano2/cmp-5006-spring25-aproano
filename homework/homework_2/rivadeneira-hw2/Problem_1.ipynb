    "To perform effective password cracking and authentication attacks, we used the widely known wordlist rockyou.txt, which contains millions of real-world passwords leaked from the 2009 RockYou data breach. This list is frequently used in penetration testing due to its high success rate in matching weak or reused passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "John the Ripper, Hashcat, and Hydra are powerful password-cracking tools widely used in cybersecurity and penetration testing.\n",
    "John the Ripper is a fast, command-line tool designed to detect weak passwords by using dictionary, brute-force, and hybrid attacks.\n",
    "Hashcat, on the other hand, is a more advanced and flexible GPU-accelerated password recovery tool that supports a wide range of hash algorithms and attack modes.\n",
    "Both tools are commonly used to audit password security and recover plaintext passwords from hashed values.\n",
    "Hydra complements these tools by performing brute-force attacks on login forms and network services, supporting multiple protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SSH. It is especially useful for testing the strength of authentication mechanisms in web applications such as DVWA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The password hashes stored in DVWA’s database are encoded using the MD5 hashing algorithm. MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed 128-bit hash from any input. Since MD5 is a one-way function, we cannot reverse it directly — instead, we use tools like John the Ripper and Hashcat to attempt to recover the original plaintext passwords by comparing the hashes to known passwords from a wordlist."

Since Hydra does not handle these dynamic tokens, it submits outdated or missing tokens, causing all login attempts to fail.
