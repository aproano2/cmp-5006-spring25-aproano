    "- **Z → h**: The pair **ZC** appears **7 times**, whereas **CZ** occurs only once. Since \"HE\" is the second most frequent digram in English, **Z** is likely **H**.\n",
    "  - Additionally, the sequence **ZCN** appears **4 times**, and \"HER\" is the fourth most common trigram in English.\n",
    "- **N → l**: This was an educated guess that turned out to be correct.\n",

    "  - Moreover, **CU** appears **once**, and **UC** appears **twice** in the digram list, aligning with \"TE\" and \"ET,\" though their frequencies are lower.\n",
    "- **S → o**: In the partially decrypted word **\"l-ved\"**, both **O** and **I** could fit. **O** was tested first, and it worked.\n",
    "- **O → n**: The sequence **GO** appears **five times**, making it likely since \"GO\" is a frequent digram in English.\n",
    "- **K → s**: **K** is the fourth most common letter in the encrypted text and cannot be a vowel—otherwise, it would create frequent sequences of three consecutive vowels (e.g., \"CKS\").\n",
    "- **I → d**: The decrypted sequence **\"ICGI\"** translates to **\"-ea-\"**, which suggests **\"dead\"**.\n",
    "  - Similarly, the partially decrypted **\"lea-e-\"** is most likely **\"leaves\"**.\n",
    "- **A → v**: Given the **I → d** substitution, the sequence **NCG-C** becomes **\"lea-e\"**, which corresponds to **\"leave\"**.\n",
    "- **W → g**: The sequence **\"WYGKK\"** deciphers to **\"-rass\"**, which is most likely **\"grass\"**.\n",
    "- **L → y**: A straightforward guess—**\"alwa-s\"** should be **\"always\"**.\n",
    "- **X → p**: Since **\"res-e-ted\"** should logically be **\"respected\"**, **X** corresponds to **P**.\n",
    "- **J → c**: Continuing from the previous substitution, **\"respe-ted\"** should be **\"respected\"**, confirming that **J** maps to **C**.\n",
