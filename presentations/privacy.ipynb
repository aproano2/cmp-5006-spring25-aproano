    "Any participant in society can violate another’s privacy, but privacy rights are especially important when it comes to entities more powerful than individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Governments like to spy on people. \n",
    "    - In 2013, whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA was illegally spying on American citizens. \n",
    "    - The FBI have been caught violating privacy rights, indicating that this is a systemic problem.\n",
    "    - “National security” is often given as an excuse, but the right to privacy is clearly being violated in most of these instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Corporations like to use your data for their benefit. \n",
    "    - Corporations are constantly collecting info to study your shopping habits, what you like and dislike, and more. \n",
    "    - They often say it’s to improve customer service, but this information can be weaponized, too. \n",
    "    - Cambridge Analytica took data from Facebook – without user consent – and used it to influence voters through political ads. \n",
    "    - This is a violation of privacy rights. After the story broke, Cambridge Analytica filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2018, while the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion in 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Privacy protects the freedom of thought and speech. \n",
    "    - Without privacy, everyone could be openly monitored and intimidated by much more powerful forces. \n",
    "    - Critics of the government – such as journalists – could have their computers seized and searched without consequences, threatening the right to freedom of speech. \n"

    "\n",
    "- In the private sector, commercial entities collect, share, and sell vast amounts of personal information for marketing and other purposes. Proliferating breaches and the demand of consumers for privacy and control of their own data have led governments to adopt new regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in that US state.\n",

    "- To mitigate cyber risk and increase privacy protection, businesses can suggest transparent and independently verifiable protections for consumers \n",

    "- It is also becoming increasingly clear that there is very little that consumers can do to mitigate their loss of privacy from third parties (with whom, very often, they do not even have a relationship).\n"
